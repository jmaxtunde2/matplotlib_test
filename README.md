As part of my Data Science journey, I explored data visualization using Matplotlib, a powerful Python library.
✅ What I’ve learned so far:

    GDP Visualization: Displayed economic trends using line and bar charts.

    Bar Charts: Compared values across categories effectively.

    Line Charts: Tracked changes and trends over time.

    Scatterplots: Showed relationships and distributions between variables.

These foundational plots help reveal insights from data and support better decision-making.
